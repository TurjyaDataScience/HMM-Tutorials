# HMM-Tutorials

This repository documents my self-directed study and implementation of Autoregressive **Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMMs)**, inspired by the article **“Autoregressive Hidden Markov Models for the Early Detection of Neonatal Sepsis” by Stanculescu et al**.
Over a 15-day intensive learning period, I studied the theoretical foundations of Hidden Markov Models and their autoregressive extensions, with a particular focus on their application to early clinical event detection. The project includes:
  -  A structured exploration of the mathematical formulation of AR-HMMs
  -  Implementation of the model in R

The primary objective of this repository is to build a solid understanding of AR-HMMs from both a theoretical and practical perspective.
As a future direction, I plan to extend this work by integrating machine learning algorithms to evaluate predictive performance. The long-term goal is to apply these methods to my own research projects in a rigorous and reproducible manner.
