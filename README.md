# HMM-Tutorials
This repository documents my 15-day self-study of Autoregressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMMs), inspired by Stanculescu et al. I explore the theoretical foundations and implement the model in R for time-series analysis. Future work will integrate machine learning methods to evaluate predictive performance and support applications in my research.
